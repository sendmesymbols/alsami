                    <p>Termites, locally referred to as Deemak they are one of some of the worst pests that live in
                        Pakistan. They thrive in humid, dark conditions and eat the cellulose in paper, wood, as well as
                        drywall. If they are not treated promptly they can cause structural damage that is serious and
                        cost thousands in repairs.</p>
