                                Pakistan and abroad. Alhamdolilah my pursuit has a little bit satisfied me to start
                                construction work as engineering professional. This is my aim to expatriate the
                                weaknesses
                                (i.e. delay of the project, low quality of work, technical mistakes etc) during the
