                        <p>
                            I commenced my career in 2003 aimed to know about construction, engineering practices in Pakistan and abroad. Alhamdolilah my pursuit has a little bit satisfied me to start construction work as engineering professional. This is my aim to expatriate the weaknesses (i.e. delay of the project, low quality of work, technical mistakes etc) during the ongoing projects. Being a consultant, contractor and even a sub contractor I came across the conditions to drive a contractor to face such problems.
