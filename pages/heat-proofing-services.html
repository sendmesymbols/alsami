                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Importance of Heat Proofing</h2>
                    <p>This question is often raised in the minds of common people in Pakistan that why heat proofing is
                        needed for their homes and buildings. Well, the answer is very simple! Pakistan is a tropical
                        country and in most of the cities of Pakistan, temperature can mount up to 45 degrees Celsius
                        and in some cases, it can be up to 50 degree Celsius. Considering major cities of Pakistan i.e.
                        Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi, the normal summer season can result in an average
                        temperature of 40 degrees Celsius. Under these hot temperature conditions, people are mostly
                        left with no other option but to use air conditioners and this ultimately results in drastic
                        increase of electricity bills. Many people are still unaware of the fact that heat proofing is a
                        very effective alternate for using air conditioners in hot summer season. If done
                        professionally, heat proofing can help to lower down the room temperature from 6 to 15 degrees
                        Celsius and that too without any increase in your normal electricity bill.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Method of Heat Proofing</h2>
                    <p>The next most important thing to understand is what is the method of heat proofing? Well, in
                        simple words, heat proofing is all about application of heat reflective chemical solutions over
                        the surface of the home or building. Now here, the quality of the heat reflective chemical
                        solutions applied by the company becomes very important. The better quality of heat reflective
                        solutions ensures that the overall service quality of heat proofing is long-lasting and durable.
                    </p>
                    <p>The major advantage of applying these best quality chemicals is that they can be applied over
                        many kinds of surfaces like concrete surfaces, wooden surfaces and metal structures and are
                        capable to reflect the ultraviolet sun rays in order to reduce the normal room temperature of
                        the building by 40% or in other words up to 15 degrees Celsius. This results in less or no usage
                        of air conditioners and room coolers which significantly reduces the electricity cost by almost
                        30 to 50% in summers.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Why You Should Opt for Heat Proofing?</h2>
                    <p>Heat proofing is an effective alternate for air conditioners in summer season but unfortunately
                        many people are unaware of it. It is the best technique to break heat penetration. The heat
                        proofing chemical naturally acts as a reflector to sun rays and acts as an insulator
                        automatically.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Reduction in Temperature</h3>
                    <p>In Pakistan, hot temperature and humid weather is becoming a part of everyday life. Homeowners
                        need to find ways to deal with such hot weather when summer season arrives. As a solution to hot
                        temperature, heat proofing services provides reduction in temperature by 30 to 40%.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Reduction in Electricity Bills</h3>
                    <p>Use of air conditioners in summer seasons result in high electricity bills. These bills can be
                        reduced by effective heat proofing services because after that there is not much need of using
                        air conditioners for longer period of time.</p>

                    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-2">Protection from Heat Waves</h3>
                    <p>Harmful heat waves in hot seasons may damage the infrastructure of building. Heat proofing
                        service resists those harmful heat waves and protects the building structure by reflecting heat
                        backwards.</p>
